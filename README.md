# Meme Generator App

## How this app works

As soon as the app loads, it immediately calls an API called ImageFlip which will return to us an array of 100 most popular meme images. Clicking the "Get a new image" button will randomly choose one image from the array of those 100 meme images. Typing in the left textbox will give us the top text and typing in the right textbox will give us the bottom text.
